Features:
- IDEA: reset ppFrames if hitting a projectile while pushing or pulling, a la bash
- IDEA: Objects that prolong your dash in the same direction as your last dash when hit
- IDEA: Projectiles that have a PP area that when dashed on will go the opposite direction, like bash
- IDEA: Water physics & controls. Water acts as a dash zone where you get to decide your dash direction like in Celeste
- IDEA: Platforms/Walls you destroy if you dash at them
- IDEA: ppObjects that float the opposite way of your dash, then smoothly come to a stop
