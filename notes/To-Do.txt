Features:
- Controller input
- IDEA: reset ppFrames if hitting a projectile while pushing or pulling, a la bash
 - Need projectiles first
- Mull over moving platforms
 - They are a bit boring. A better alternative would be to just have moving PP objects instead

Game Feel & Oil


Graphics
- Sprites with the AI frame interpolation
- (Polish shader with clamped values instead of if-statements)

Sound
- Default BGM
- Final Scene BGM
- Research audio emitters for environment sounds
 - Probably not needed for such a simple game, if onscreen, make sound, if not, don't
