Features:
- Controller input
- IDEA: reset ppFrames if hitting a projectile while pushing or pulling, a la bash
 - Need projectiles first
- IDEA: Objects that prolong your dash in the same direction as your last dash when hit
- Mull over moving platforms
 - They are a bit boring. A better alternative would be to just have moving PP objects instead
- Some kind of indicator whether you have a dash charge
