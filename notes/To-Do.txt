Features:
- Controller input
- IDEA: reset ppFrames if hitting a projectile while pushing or pulling, a la bash
- IDEA: Save hsp and vsp when dashing and add it to the ppSpeed for some conservation of momentum
- mull over moving platforms
 - They are a bit boring. A better alternative would be to just have moving PP objects instead
- Make dash conserve momentum a bit more for wavedash-like experience

Game Feel & Oil
- Edge allowance for one-way platforms
- Possible buffer & coyote time for walljump

Graphics
- Particles
  - Secondary pp particles
  
- Sprites with the AI frame interpolation
- (Polish shader with clamped values instead of if-statements)
- Make pp indicator lights draw on light surface

Sound
- Default BGM
- Final Scene BGM
- PP object ambient
- PP object activation
- PP object indicator direction change
- Research audio emitters for environment sounds
 - Probably not needed for such a simple game, if onscreen, make sound, if not, don't
