Features:
- IDEA: reset ppFrames if hitting a projectile while pushing or pulling, a la bash
- IDEA: Objects that prolong your dash in the same direction as your last dash when hit
- IDEA: Projectiles that have a PP area that when dashed on will go the opposite direction, like bash
- IDEA: Water physics & controls. Water acts as a dash zone where you get to decide your dash direction like in Celeste

- Level select screen

- Mull over moving platforms
 - They are a bit boring. A better alternative would be to just have moving PP objects instead
- Moving ppObjects
 - Paths? Just back and forth? Both? Need research

Game Feel & Oil
- Rounded hitboxes for enemies/hazards

Graphics
- AI interpolation for player animations?
- Polish grass shader
- Polish ground tileset

Sound
- Default BGM
- Main menu BGM
- Final Scene BGM
- New rain ambient audio
- Walking SFX
- MIX SFX FILES TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH AUDIO SLIDERS

- Research audio emitters for environment sounds
 - Probably not needed for such a simple game, if onscreen, make sound, if not, don't
