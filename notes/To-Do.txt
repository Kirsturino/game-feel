Features:
- IDEA: reset ppFrames if hitting a projectile while pushing or pulling, a la bash
- IDEA: Objects that prolong your dash in the same direction as your last dash when hit
- IDEA: Projectiles that have a PP area that when dashed on will go the opposite direction, like bash
- IDEA: Water physics & controls. Water acts as a dash zone where you get to decide your dash direction like in Celeste
- IDEA: Platforms/Walls you destroy if you dash at them
- IDEA: ppObjects that float the opposite way of your dash, then smoothly come to a stop
- IDEA: Celeste-like binoculars

- World 1
- Triggers that change camera zoom
- Improve camera logic somehow maybe?
- freecam
- 
- Input buffering / Coyote time for dashes

- There's a weird bug that extends your dash sometimes, but eats the refresh thing, breaks stuff, but happens very rarely

- Mull over moving platforms
 - They are a bit boring. A better alternative would be to just have moving PP objects instead
- Moving ppObjects
 - Paths? Just back and forth? Both? Need research
