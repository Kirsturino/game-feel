Features:
- IDEA: reset ppFrames if hitting a projectile while pushing or pulling, a la bash
- IDEA: Objects that prolong your dash in the same direction as your last dash when hit
- IDEA: Projectiles that have a PP area that when dashed on will go the opposite direction, like bash

- Mull over moving platforms
 - They are a bit boring. A better alternative would be to just have moving PP objects instead
- Moving ppObjects
 - Paths? Just back and forth? Both? Need research
